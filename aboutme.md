### My story

In the heart of Paris, amidst the bustling streets and vibrant culture, my journey began. I'm Adam Medragh, a dedicated MSc AI student at INSA Centre-Val de Loire, driven by a passion for technology and a profound commitment to making a positive impact on the world around me. My story is not just about my academic achievements or technical skills, but about my unwavering commitment to work hard, innovate, and improve lives through technology.

From a young age, I was fascinated by the potential of artificial intelligence and machine learning to solve complex problems and bring about social good. My technical proficiency spans a broad spectrum, from operating systems like Ubuntu and Windows to programming languages including Python and Java. I've honed my skills in artificial intelligence with tools like TensorFlow and PyTorch, and I've explored the depths of databases with mySQL and MongoDB. These technical skills are the foundation upon which I've built my career, but it's my passion and drive that have truly shaped my path.

My journey has taken me around the world, from the prestigious University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest, where I engaged in AI and machine learning research, to an exciting machine learning engineering internship in Singapore with MicroSec. There, I developed a cybersecurity framework that uses machine learning for authentication and intrusion detection. This project was not just a technical achievement; it was a testament to my commitment to using technology to create a safer, more secure world.

Back in Europe, I contributed to the advancement of deep learning technologies at Nucl√©tudes, an ArianeGroup company, where I worked on object recognition software for satellite maps. This experience underscored the potential of AI to transform industries and improve our understanding of the world.

Beyond my professional and academic pursuits, I've actively participated in community involvement and leadership roles, such as the President of the Sport division for the High Five 2022 event in Bourges, and Treasurer of the 2021 Poker Student Club. These roles have taught me the importance of teamwork, leadership, and the impact of contributing to one's community.

My story is still unfolding, but my dedication to my work and the people around me remains unwavering. I am on a continuous journey to harness the power of technology to improve lives, drive societal progress, and inspire others to join me in making a difference in the world. My aspirations are not just about advancing my career, but about being a catalyst for positive change.
